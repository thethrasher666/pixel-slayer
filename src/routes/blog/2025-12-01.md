## Welcome to Pixel Slayer

I recently rebuilt this site using **SvelteKit**, moving away from Astro. While Astro served its purpose, I wanted to deepen my skills with SvelteKit's reactive programming model and gain more hands-on experience with the framework. Plus, building your own portfolio site is always a good excuse to learn something new.

More importantly, I wanted a space that actually reflects who I am—not just another generic developer portfolio. So here it is: a site that combines my professional work in game development with my lifelong love of thrash metal.

## What's Here

This site showcases the projects I've worked on over my career, from PS2 titles to modern VR and VFX software. I'll also be writing occasional posts about game development, graphics programming, and yes, metal music when the mood strikes.

If you're interested in any of that, welcome. If not, that's cool too.

Thanks for stopping by.
